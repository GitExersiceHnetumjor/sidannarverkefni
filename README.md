## About
This is a repository for a web application that plays the game TicTacToe.

TicTacToe is an old and famous game that revolves around two players playing on a 3x3 board. Each player plays with an X or an O and take turn placing their character in one of the 3x3 Squares. A game can be won by either players or the game can be a draw. The game is won when a player has either 3 of his characters vertically or horizontally or incline. The game is a draw when all 9 squares have been filled and no wins are made. Two players can play in our game.
